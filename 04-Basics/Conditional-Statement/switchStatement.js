//In this statement the expression and variables are in match

//break is important in switch case because it prevents fall through
//fall through is when the program keeps on executing the block of code even when the condition has met

/*Prevents Fall-Through: Without break,
the program will continue executing subsequent cases even after a match is found, 
leading to potentially incorrect or unexpected behavior. */
